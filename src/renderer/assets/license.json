The browser is downloaded to the `$HOME/.cache/puppeteer` folder\nby default (starting with Puppeteer v19.0.0).\n\nIf you deploy a project using Puppeteer to a hosting provider, such as Render or\nHeroku, you might need to reconfigure the location of the cache to be within\nyour project folder (see an example below) because not all hosting providers\ninclude `$HOME/.cache` into the project's deployment.\n\nFor a version of Puppeteer without the browser installation, see\n[`puppeteer-core`](#puppeteer-core).\n\nIf used with TypeScript, the minimum supported TypeScript version is `4.7.4`.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nPuppeteer uses several defaults that can be customized through configuration\nfiles.\n\nFor example, to change the default cache directory Puppeteer uses to install\nbrowsers, you can add a `.puppeteerrc.cjs` (or `puppeteer.config.cjs`) at the\nroot of your application with the contents\n\n```js\nconst {join} = require('path');\n\n/**\n * @type {import(\"puppeteer\").Configuration}\n */\nmodule.exports = {\n  // Changes the cache location for Puppeteer.\n  cacheDirectory: join(__dirname, '.cache', 'puppeteer'),\n};\n```\n\nAfter adding the configuration file, you will need to remove and reinstall\n`puppeteer` for it to take effect.\n\nSee the [configuration guide](https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration) for more\ninformation.\n\n#### `puppeteer-core`\n\nFor every release since v1.7.0 we publish two packages:\n\n- [`puppeteer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)\n- [`puppeteer-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core)\n\n`puppeteer` is a _product_ for browser automation. When installed, it downloads\na version of Chrome, which it then drives using `puppeteer-core`. Being an\nend-user product, `puppeteer` automates several workflows using reasonable\ndefaults [that can be customized](https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration).\n\n`puppeteer-core` is a _library_ to help drive anything that supports DevTools\nprotocol. Being a library, `puppeteer-core` is fully driven through its\nprogrammatic interface implying no defaults are assumed and `puppeteer-core`\nwill not download Chrome when installed.\n\nYou should use `puppeteer-core` if you are\n[connecting to a remote browser](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteer.connect)\nor [managing browsers yourself](https://pptr.dev/browsers-api/).\nIf you are managing browsers yourself, you will need to call\n[`puppeteer.launch`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteernode.launch) with\nan explicit\n[`executablePath`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.launchoptions)\n(or [`channel`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.launchoptions) if it's\ninstalled in a standard location).\n\nWhen using `puppeteer-core`, remember to change the import:\n\n```ts\nimport puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nPuppeteer follows the latest\n[maintenance LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) version of\nNode.\n\nPuppeteer will be familiar to people using other browser testing frameworks. You\n[launch](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteernode.launch)/[connect](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteernode.connect)\na [browser](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browser),\n[create](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browser.newpage) some\n[pages](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page), and then manipulate them with\n[Puppeteer's API](https://pptr.dev/api).\n\nFor more in-depth usage, check our [guides](https://pptr.dev/category/guides)\nand [examples](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main/examples).\n\n#### Example\n\nThe following example searches [developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/) for blog posts with text \"automate beyond recorder\", click on the first result and print the full title of the blog post.\n\n```ts\nimport puppeteer from 'puppeteer';\n\n(async () => {\n  // Launch the browser and open a new blank page\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n\n  // Navigate the page to a URL\n  await page.goto('https://developer.chrome.com/');\n\n  // Set screen size\n  await page.setViewport({width: 1080, height: 1024});\n\n  // Type into search box\n  await page.type('.search-box__input', 'automate beyond recorder');\n\n  // Wait and click on first result\n  const searchResultSelector = '.search-box__link';\n  await page.waitForSelector(searchResultSelector);\n  await page.click(searchResultSelector);\n\n  // Locate the full title with a unique string\n  const textSelector = await page.waitForSelector(\n    'text/Customize and automate'\n  );\n  const fullTitle = await textSelector?.evaluate(el => el.textContent);\n\n  // Print the full title\n  console.log('The title of this blog post is \"%s\".', fullTitle);\n\n  await browser.close();\n})();\n```\n\n### Default runtime settings\n\n**1. Uses Headless mode**\n\nBy default Puppeteer launches Chrome in\n[old Headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/).\n\n```ts\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n// Equivalent to\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: true});\n```\n\n[Chrome 112 launched a new Headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/) that might cause some differences in behavior compared to the old Headless implementation.\nIn the future Puppeteer will start defaulting to new implementation.\nWe recommend you try it out before the switch:\n\n```ts\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: 'new'});\n```\n\nTo launch a \"headful\" version of Chrome, set the\n[`headless`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browserlaunchargumentoptions) to `false`\noption when launching a browser:\n\n```ts\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});\n```\n\n**2. Runs a bundled version of Chrome**\n\nBy default, Puppeteer downloads and uses a specific version of Chrome so its\nAPI is guaranteed to work out of the box. To use Puppeteer with a different\nversion of Chrome or Chromium, pass in the executable's path when creating a\n`Browser` instance:\n\n```ts\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({executablePath: '/path/to/Chrome'});\n```\n\nYou can also use Puppeteer with Firefox. See\n[status of cross-browser support](https://pptr.dev/faq/#q-what-is-the-status-of-cross-browser-support) for\nmore information.\n\nSee\n[`this article`](https://www.howtogeek.com/202825/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-chromium-and-chrome/)\nfor a description of the differences between Chromium and Chrome.\n[`This article`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/chromium_browser_vs_google_chrome.md)\ndescribes some differences for Linux users.\n\n**3. Creates a fresh user profile**\n\nPuppeteer creates its own browser user profile which it **cleans up on every\nrun**.\n\n#### Using Docker\n\nSee our [Docker guide](https://pptr.dev/guides/docker).\n\n#### Using Chrome Extensions\n\nSee our [Chrome extensions guide](https://pptr.dev/guides/chrome-extensions).\n\n## Resources\n\n- [API Documentation](https://pptr.dev/api)\n- [Guides](https://pptr.dev/category/guides)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main/examples)\n- [Community list of Puppeteer resources](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/awesome-puppeteer)\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out our [contributing guide](https://pptr.dev/contributing) to get an\noverview of Puppeteer development.\n\n## FAQ\n\nOur [FAQ](https://pptr.dev/faq) has migrated to\n[our site](https://pptr.dev/faq).\n","packages":[["puppeteer-core@21.7.0","https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main/packages/puppeteer-core"],["puppeteer@21.7.0","https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main/packages/puppeteer"]]},{"license":"Apache-2.0","licenseText":"Apache License\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0, January 2004\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/ \r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n1.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n","packages":[["typescript@5.3.3","https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript"]]},{"license":"BSD-2-Clause","licenseText":"Copyright (c) Felix Böhm\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\nRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`\nfunction includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked\nto determine what type of socket should be returned.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere are some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`\nbased on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both\nthe `http` and `https` modules.\n\n```ts\nimport * as net from 'net';\nimport * as tls from 'tls';\nimport * as http from 'http';\nimport { Agent } from 'agent-base';\n\nclass MyAgent extends Agent {\n  connect(req, opts) {\n    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the \"https\" module\n    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n      return tls.connect(opts);\n    } else {\n      return net.connect(opts);\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be\n// invoked when a new connection needs to be created\nconst agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });\n\n// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request\nhttp.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: ../http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: ../https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: ../pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: ../socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent\n","packages":[["agent-base@7.1.0","https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents"]]},{"license":"MIT","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Sindre Sorhus <sindresorhus@gmail.com> (sindresorhus.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did\nand HTTP request and returned the response body.\n\nThe user has provided us with this implementation:\n\n``` js\nfunction myFn() {\n  const one = get('https://google.com');\n  const two = get('http://nodejs.org');\n  const three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));\n  return [one, two, three];\n}\n```\n\nNow we can compile this into an asyncronous function, implement the\nasync `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function\ninstance with the `vm` module:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport vm from 'vm';\nimport { degenerator } from 'degenerator';\n\n// The `get()` function is Promise-based (error handling omitted for brevity)\nfunction get(endpoint: string) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');\n    var req = mod.get(endpoint);\n    req.on('response', function (res) {\n      var data = '';\n      res.setEncoding('utf8');\n      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });\n      res.on('end', function () {\n        resolve(data);\n      });\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n// Convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)\nstr = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);\n\n// Turn the JS String into a real async function instance\nconst asyncFn = vm.runInNewContext(`(${str})`, { get });\n\n// Now we can invoke the function asynchronously\nasyncFn().then((res) => {\n  // Do something with `res`...\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### degenerator(code: string, names: Array<string|RegExp>): String\n\nReturns a \"degeneratorified\" JavaScript string, with `async`/`await` transplanted.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n","packages":[["degenerator@5.0.1","https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents"]]},{"license":"MIT","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Alexey Prokhorov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `proxy` argument is the URL for the proxy server.\n\nThe `options` argument accepts the usual `http.Agent` constructor options, and\nsome additional properties:\n\n * `headers` - Object containing additional headers to send to the proxy server\n   in the `CONNECT` request.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling\n","packages":[["https-proxy-agent@7.0.2","https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents"]]},{"license":"MIT","licenseText":"# IP  \n[![](https://badge.fury.io/js/ip.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip)  \n\nIP address utilities for node.js\n\n## Installation\n\n###  npm\n```shell\nnpm install ip\n```\n\n### git\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/indutny/node-ip.git\n```\n  \n## Usage\nGet your ip address, compare ip addresses, validate ip addresses, etc.\n\n```js\nvar ip = require('ip');\n\nip.address() // my ip address\nip.isEqual('::1', '::0:1'); // true\nip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1') // Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])\nip.toString(new Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])) // 127.0.0.1\nip.fromPrefixLen(24) // 255.255.255.0\nip.mask('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.0') // 192.168.1.0\nip.cidr('192.168.1.134/26') // 192.168.1.128\nip.not('255.255.255.0') // 0.0.0.255\nip.or('192.168.1.134', '0.0.0.255') // 192.168.1.255\nip.isPrivate('127.0.0.1') // true\nip.isV4Format('127.0.0.1'); // true\nip.isV6Format('::ffff:127.0.0.1'); // true\n\n// operate on buffers in-place\nvar buf = new Buffer(128);\nvar offset = 64;\nip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1', buf, offset);  // [127, 0, 0, 1] at offset 64\nip.toString(buf, offset, 4);            // '127.0.0.1'\n\n// subnet information\nip.subnet('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.192')\n// { networkAddress: '192.168.1.128',\n//   firstAddress: '192.168.1.129',\n//   lastAddress: '192.168.1.190',\n//   broadcastAddress: '192.168.1.191',\n//   subnetMask: '255.255.255.192',\n//   subnetMaskLength: 26,\n//   numHosts: 62,\n//   length: 64,\n//   contains: function(addr){...} }\nip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26')\n// Same as previous.\n\n// range checking\nip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26').contains('192.168.1.190') // true\n\n\n// ipv4 long conversion\nip.toLong('127.0.0.1'); // 2130706433\nip.fromLong(2130706433); // '127.0.0.1'\n```\n\n### License\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2012.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\n```js\nvar Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask\n\nvar block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');\nblock.base;                     // 10.0.0.0\nblock.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0\nblock.bitmask;                  // 12\nblock.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255\nblock.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255\nblock.size;                     // 1048576\nblock.first;                    // 10.0.0.1\nblock.last;                     // 10.15.255.254\n\nblock.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true\nblock.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true\nblock.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false\n\nblock.forEach(function(ip, long, index));\n\nblock.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')\n```\n\nConstructing\n------------\n\nNetmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:\n\n```\n'216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.\n'216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'\n'216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'\n'216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00\n'216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.\n'0330.0360.040.04'              // Octal form\n'0xd8.0xf0.0x20.0x4'            // Hex form\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.\n- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).\n- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).\n- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).\n- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).\n- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)\n- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address\n- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.\n- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.\n- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.
