So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did\nand HTTP request and returned the response body.\n\nThe user has provided us with this implementation:\n\n``` js\nfunction myFn() {\n  const one = get('https://google.com');\n  const two = get('http://nodejs.org');\n  const three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));\n  return [one, two, three];\n}\n```\n\nNow we can compile this into an asyncronous function, implement the\nasync `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function\ninstance with the `vm` module:\n\n\n```typescript\nimport vm from 'vm';\nimport { degenerator } from 'degenerator';\n\n// The `get()` function is Promise-based (error handling omitted for brevity)\nfunction get(endpoint: string) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');\n    var req = mod.get(endpoint);\n    req.on('response', function (res) {\n      var data = '';\n      res.setEncoding('utf8');\n      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });\n      res.on('end', function () {\n        resolve(data);\n      });\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n// Convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)\nstr = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);\n\n// Turn the JS String into a real async function instance\nconst asyncFn = vm.runInNewContext(`(${str})`, { get });\n\n// Now we can invoke the function asynchronously\nasyncFn().then((res) => {\n  // Do something with `res`...\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### degenerator(code: string, names: Array<string|RegExp>): String\n\nReturns a \"degeneratorified\" JavaScript string, with `async`/`await` transplanted.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n","packages":[["degenerator@5.0.1","https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents"]]},{"license":"MIT","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Alexey Prokhorov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\n```js\nvar Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask\n\nvar block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');\nblock.base;                     // 10.0.0.0\nblock.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0\nblock.bitmask;                  // 12\nblock.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255\nblock.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255\nblock.size;                     // 1048576\nblock.first;                    // 10.0.0.1\nblock.last;                     // 10.15.255.254\n\nblock.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true\nblock.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true\nblock.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false\n\nblock.forEach(function(ip, long, index));\n\nblock.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')\n```\n\nConstructing\n------------\n\nNetmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:\n\n```\n'216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.\n'216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'\n'216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'\n'216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00\n'216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.\n'0330.0360.040.04'              // Octal form\n'0xd8.0xf0.0x20.0x4'            // Hex form\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.\n- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).\n- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).\n- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).\n- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).\n- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)\n- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address\n- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.\n- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.\n- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one.

Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.
