@puppeteer/browsers@1.9.1 (https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main/packages/browsers)

# @puppeteer/browsers

Manage and launch browsers/drivers from a CLI or programmatically.

## CLI

Use `npx` to run the CLI:

```bash
npx @puppeteer/browsers --help
```

CLI help will provide all documentation you need to use the CLI.

```bash
npx @puppeteer/browsers --help # help for all commands
npx @puppeteer/browsers install --help # help for the install command
npx @puppeteer/browsers launch --help # help for the launch command
```

## Known limitations

1. We support installing and running Firefox, Chrome and Chromium. The `latest`, `beta`, `dev`, `canary`, `stable` keywords are only supported for the install command. For the `launch` command you need to specify an exact build ID. The build ID is provided by the `install` command (see `npx @puppeteer/browsers install --help` for the format).
2. Launching the system browsers is only possible for Chrome/Chromium.

## API

The programmatic API allows installing and launching browsers from your code. See the `test` folder for examples on how to use the `install`, `canInstall`, `launch`, `computeExecutablePath`, `computeSystemExecutablePath` and other methods.

#### [Guides](https://pptr.dev/category/guides) | [API](https://pptr.dev/api) | [FAQ](https://pptr.dev/faq) | [Contributing](https://pptr.dev/contributing) | [Troubleshooting](https://pptr.dev/troubleshooting)

> Chrome/Chromium over the
> [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

#### What can I do?

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer!
Here are a few examples to get you started:

- Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
- Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e.
  "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
- Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
- Create an automated testing environment using the latest JavaScript and
  browser features.
- Capture a
  [timeline trace](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference)
  of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
- [Test Chrome Extensions](https://pptr.dev/guides/chrome-extensions).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use Puppeteer in your project, run:

```bash
npm i puppeteer
# or using yarn
yarn add puppeteer
# or using pnpm
pnpm i puppeteer
```

When you install Puppeteer, it automatically downloads a recent version of
[Chrome for Testing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) (~170MB macOS, ~282MB Linux, ~280MB Windows) that is [guaranteed to
work](https://pptr.dev/faq#q-why-doesnt-puppeteer-vxxx-work-with-chromium-vyyy)
with Puppeteer. The browser is downloaded to the `$HOME/.cache/puppeteer` folder
by default (starting with Puppeteer v19.0.0).

If you deploy a project using Puppeteer to a hosting provider, such as Render or
Heroku, you might need to reconfigure the location of the cache to be within
your project folder (see an example below) because not all hosting providers
include `$HOME/.cache` into the project's deployment.

For a version of Puppeteer without the browser installation, see
[`puppeteer-core`](#puppeteer-core).

If used with TypeScript, the minimum supported TypeScript version is `4.7.4`.

#### Configuration

Puppeteer uses several defaults that can be customized through configuration
files.

For example, to change the default cache directory Puppeteer uses to install
browsers, you can add a `.puppeteerrc.cjs` (or `puppeteer.config.cjs`) at the
root of your application with the contents

```js
const {join} = require('path');

/**
 * @type {import("puppeteer").Configuration}
 */
module.exports = {
  // Changes the cache location for Puppeteer.
  cacheDirectory: join(__dirname, '.cache', 'puppeteer'),
};
```

After adding the configuration file, you will need to remove and reinstall
`puppeteer` for it to take effect.

See the [configuration guide](https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration) for more
information.

#### `puppeteer-core`

For every release since v1.7.0 we publish two packages:

- [`puppeteer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)
- [`puppeteer-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core)

`puppeteer` is a _product_ for browser automation. When installed, it downloads
a version of Chrome, which it then drives using `puppeteer-core`. Being an
end-user product, `puppeteer` automates several workflows using reasonable
defaults [that can be customized](https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration).

`puppeteer-core` is a _library_ to help drive anything that supports DevTools
protocol. Being a library, `puppeteer-core` is fully driven through its
programmatic interface implying no defaults are assumed and `puppeteer-core`
will not download Chrome when installed.

You should use `puppeteer-core` if you are
[connecting to a remote browser](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteer.connect)
or [managing browsers yourself](https://pptr.dev/browsers-api/).
If you are managing browsers yourself, you will need to call
[`puppeteer.launch`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteernode.launch) with
an explicit
[`executablePath`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.launchoptions)
(or [`channel`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.launchoptions) if it's
installed in a standard location).

When using `puppeteer-core`, remember to change the import:

```ts
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core';
```

### Usage

Puppeteer follows the latest
[maintenance LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) version of
Node.

Puppeteer will be familiar to people using other browser testing frameworks. You
[launch](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteernode.launch)/[connect](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteernode.connect)
a [browser](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browser),
[create](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browser.newpage) some
[pages](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.page), and then manipulate them with
[Puppeteer's API](https://pptr.dev/api).

For more in-depth usage, check our [guides](https://pptr.dev/category/guides)
and [examples](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/tree/main/examples).

#### Example

The following example searches [developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/) for blog posts with text "automate beyond recorder", click on the first result and print the full title of the blog post.

```ts
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

(async () => {
  // Launch the browser and open a new blank page
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate the page to a URL
  await page.goto('https://developer.chrome.com/');

  // Set screen size
  await page.setViewport({width: 1080, height: 1024});

  // Type into search box
  await page.type('.search-box__input', 'automate beyond recorder');

  // Wait and click on first result
  const searchResultSelector = '.search-box__link';
  await page.waitForSelector(searchResultSelector);
  await page.click(searchResultSelector);

  // Locate the full title with a unique string
  const textSelector = await page.waitForSelector(
    'text/Customize and automate'
  );
  const fullTitle = await textSelector?.evaluate(el => el.textContent);

  // Print the full title
  console.log('The title of this blog post is "%s".', fullTitle);

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Default runtime settings

**1. Uses Headless mode**

By default Puppeteer launches Chrome in
[old Headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/).

```ts
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
// Equivalent to
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: true});
```

[Chrome 112 launched a new Headless mode](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/) that might cause some differences in behavior compared to the old Headless implementation.
In the future Puppeteer will start defaulting to new implementation.
We recommend you try it out before the switch:

```ts
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: 'new'});
```

To launch a "headful" version of Chrome, set the
[`headless`](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browserlaunchargumentoptions) to `false`
option when launching a browser:

```ts
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});
```

**2. Runs a bundled version of Chrome**

By default, Puppeteer downloads and uses a specific version of Chrome so its
API is guaranteed to work out of the box. To use Puppeteer with a different
version of Chrome or Chromium, pass in the executable's path when creating a
`Browser` instance:

```ts
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({executablePath: '/path/to/Chrome'});
```

You can also use Puppeteer with Firefox. See
[status of cross-browser support](https://pptr.dev/faq/#q-what-is-the-status-of-cross-browser-support) for
more information.

See
[`this article`](https://www.howtogeek.com/202825/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-chromium-and-chrome/)
for a description of the differences between Chromium and Chrome.
[`This article`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/chromium_browser_vs_google_chrome.md)
describes some differences for Linux users.

**3. Creates a fresh user profile**

Puppeteer creates its own browser user profile which it **cleans up on every
run**.

agent-base@7.1.0 (https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents)

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance

This module is a thin wrapper around the base `http.Agent` class.

It provides an abstract class that must define a `connect()` function,
which is responsible for creating the underlying socket that the HTTP
client requests will use.

The `connect()` function may return an arbitrary `Duplex` stream, or
another `http.Agent` instance to delegate the request to, and may be
asynchronous (by defining an `async` function).

Instances of this agent can be used with the `http` and `https`
modules. To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`
function includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked
to determine what type of socket should be returned.

#### Some subclasses:

Here are some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`
based on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both
the `http` and `https` modules.

```ts
import * as net from 'net';
import * as tls from 'tls';
import * as http from 'http';
import { Agent } from 'agent-base';

class MyAgent extends Agent {
  connect(req, opts) {
    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the "https" module
    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
      return tls.connect(opts);
    } else {
      return net.connect(opts);
    }
  }
});

// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be
// invoked when a new connection needs to be created
const agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });

// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request
http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

degenerator@5.0.1 (https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents)

degenerator
===========
### Compiles sync functions into async functions

Sometimes you need to write sync looking code that's really async under the hood.
This module takes a String to one or more synchronous JavaScript functions, and
returns a new String that with those JS functions transpiled into `async`
functions.

So this:

```js
function foo() {
  return a('bar') || b();
}
```

Gets compiled into:

```js
async function foo() {
    return await a('bar') || await b();
}
```

With the compiled output code, you can evaluate the code using the `vm` module
in Node.js, or save the code to a file and require it, or whatever.

Example
-------

You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be
"asyncified". So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did
and HTTP request and returned the response body.

The user has provided us with this implementation:

``` js
function myFn() {
  const one = get('https://google.com');
  const two = get('http://nodejs.org');
  const three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));
  return [one, two, three];
}
```

Now we can compile this into an asyncronous function, implement the
async `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function
instance with the `vm` module:


```typescript
import vm from 'vm';
import { degenerator } from 'degenerator';

// The `get()` function is Promise-based (error handling omitted for brevity)
function get(endpoint: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');
    var req = mod.get(endpoint);
    req.on('response', function (res) {
      var data = '';
      res.setEncoding('utf8');
      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });
      res.on('end', function () {
        resolve(data);
      });
    });
  });
}

// Convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)
str = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);

// Turn the JS String into a real async function instance
const asyncFn = vm.runInNewContext(`(${str})`, { get });

// Now we can invoke the function asynchronously
asyncFn().then((res) => {
  // Do something with `res`...
});
```


API
---

### degenerator(code: string, names: Array<string|RegExp>): String

Returns a "degeneratorified" JavaScript string, with `async`/`await` transplanted.

https-proxy-agent@7.0.2 (https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents)

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.

Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

```ts
import * as https from 'https';
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';

const agent = new HttpsProxyAgent('http://168.63.76.32:3128');

https.get('https://example.com', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

```ts
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { HttpsProxyAgent } from 'https-proxy-agent';

const agent = new HttpsProxyAgent('http://168.63.76.32:3128');
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org', { agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy: string | URL, options?: HttpsProxyAgentOptions)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `proxy` argument is the URL for the proxy server.

The `options` argument accepts the usual `http.Agent` constructor options, and
some additional properties:

 * `headers` - Object containing additional headers to send to the proxy server
   in the `CONNECT` request.

netmask@2.0.2 (https://github.com/rs/node-netmask)

Netmask
=======

The Netmask class parses and understands IPv4 CIDR blocks so they can be explored and compared. This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.

Synopsis
--------

```js
var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask

var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');
block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0
block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0
block.bitmask;                  // 12
block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255
block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255
block.size;                     // 1048576
block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1
block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254

block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true
block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true
block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false

block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));

block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')
```

Constructing
------------

Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:

```
'216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.
'216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'
'216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00
'216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.
'0330.0360.040.04'              // Octal form
'0xd8.0xf0.0x20.0x4'            // Hex form
```

API
---

- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.
- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).
- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).
- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).
- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).
- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)
- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address
- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.
- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.
- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space.
- `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')

pac-proxy-agent@7.0.1 (https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents)

pac-proxy-agent
===============
### A [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that retreives the specified
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia] and uses it to resolve which HTTP, HTTPS, or
SOCKS proxy, or if a direct connection should be used to connect to the
HTTP endpoint.

It is designed to be be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.

Example
-------

```ts
import * as http from 'http';
import { PacProxyAgent } from 'pac-proxy-agent';

const agent = new PacProxyAgent('pac+https://cloudup.com/ceGH2yZ0Bjp+');

http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

pac-resolver@7.0.0 (https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents)

pac-resolver
============
### Generates an asynchronous resolver function from a [PAC file][pac-wikipedia]


This module accepts a JavaScript String of code, which is meant to be a
[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia], and returns a generated asynchronous
`FindProxyForURL()` function.

Example
-------

Given the PAC proxy file named `proxy.pac`:

```js
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
  if (isInNet(myIpAddress(), "10.1.10.0", "255.255.255.0")) {
    return "PROXY 1.2.3.4:8080";
  } else {
    return "DIRECT";
  }
}
```

You can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { createPacResolver } from 'pac-resolver';

const FindProxyForURL = createPacResolver(readFileSync('proxy.pac'));

const res = await FindProxyForURL('http://foo.com/');
console.log(res);
// "DIRECT"
```


API
---

### pac(qjs: QuickJSWASMModule, pacFileContents: string | Buffer, options?: PacResolverOptions) → Function

Returns an asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function based off of the given JS
string `pacFileContents` PAC proxy file. An optional `options` object may be
passed in which respects the following options:

 * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.
 * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the
 JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to
 include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For
 async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function
 instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were
 synchronous.

 The `qjs` parameter is a QuickJS module instance as returned from `getQuickJS()` from the `quickjs-emscripten` module.

proxy-agent@6.3.1 (https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents)

proxy-agent
===========
### Maps proxy protocols to `http.Agent` implementations

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation which automatically uses
proxy servers based off of the various proxy-related environment variables
(`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` among others).

Which proxy is used for each HTTP request is determined by the
[`proxy-from-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env) module, so
check its documentation for instructions on configuring your environment variables.

An LRU cache is used so that `http.Agent` instances are transparently re-used for
subsequent HTTP requests to the same proxy server.

The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:


| Protocol   | Proxy Agent for `http` requests | Proxy Agent for `https` requests | Example
|:----------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:--------:
| `http`     | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `http://proxy-server-over-tcp.com:3128`
| `https`    | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `https://proxy-server-over-tls.com:3129`
| `socks(v5)`| [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks5`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks5://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks4`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks4://some-socks-proxy.com:9050`
| `pac-*`    | [pac-proxy-agent][]             | [pac-proxy-agent][]              | `pac+http://www.example.com/proxy.pac`

Example
-------

```ts
import * as https from 'https';
import { ProxyAgent } from 'proxy-agent';

// The correct proxy `Agent` implementation to use will be determined
// via the `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` / `no_proxy` / etc. env vars
const agent = new ProxyAgent();

// The rest works just like any other normal HTTP request
https.get('https://jsonip.com', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log(res.statusCode, res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```


API
---

### new ProxyAgent(options?: ProxyAgentOptions)

Creates an `http.Agent` instance which relies on the various proxy-related
environment variables. An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance
will be returned if identical args are passed in.

socks-proxy-agent@8.0.2 (https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents)

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
and `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Examples
--------

```ts
import https from 'https';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(
	'socks://your-name%40gmail.com:abcdef12345124@br41.nordvpn.com'
);

https.get('https://ipinfo.io', { agent }, (res) => {
	console.log(res.headers);
	res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

```ts
import WebSocket from 'ws';
import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';

const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(
	'socks://your-name%40gmail.com:abcdef12345124@br41.nordvpn.com'
);

var socket = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.events', { agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
	console.log('"open" event!');
	socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
	socket.close();
});
```

Python-2.0

argparse@2.0.1 (https://github.com/nodeca/argparse)

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
